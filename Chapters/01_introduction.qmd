# Introduction {#sec-ch1}

This chapter demonstrates various Quarto features you can use in your thesis. Cross-references like @sec-background, @fig-sample-logo, @tbl-comparison, and @eq-regression work throughout the document.

## Background and Motivation {#sec-background}

Quarto supports **bold**, *italic*, and `inline code`. You can cite references like this [@sample2023research] or with multiple citations [@sample2023research; @example2022deep].

### Including Figures {#sec-figures}

You can include images from the `images/` or `Figures/` directory with captions and cross-references:

![Sample figure caption - replace with your own figure](images/logo.png){#fig-sample-logo width=40%}

Reference figures using @fig-sample-logo in your text. The figure will be automatically numbered and added to the List of Figures.

**To add your own figures:**

1. Place image files in the `Figures/` directory (e.g., `Figures/Chapter1/my_diagram.png`)
2. Reference them like: `![Caption here](Figures/Chapter1/my_diagram.png){#fig-my-diagram width=60%}`
3. Use `@fig-my-diagram` to reference in text

## Mathematical Equations {#sec-equations}

Inline equations use single dollar signs: $E = mc^2$ or $\alpha + \beta = \gamma$

Display equations use double dollar signs:

$$
y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 + \epsilon
$$ {#eq-regression}

You can reference equations like @eq-regression in your text.

More complex equations with Greek letters:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{CE} = -\sum_{i=1}^{N} \sum_{c=1}^{C} y_{ic} \log(\hat{y}_{ic})
$$ {#eq-cross-entropy}

where $\mathcal{L}_{CE}$ is the cross-entropy loss (@eq-cross-entropy), $N$ is the number of samples, $C$ is the number of classes, $y_{ic}$ is the true label, and $\hat{y}_{ic}$ is the predicted probability.

Matrix notation example:

$$
\mathbf{H} = \text{ReLU}(\mathbf{W}_1 \mathbf{X} + \mathbf{b}_1)
$$ {#eq-hidden-layer}

## Tables {#sec-tables}

### Simple Markdown Tables

| Method | Accuracy | F1-Score | Reference |
|--------|:--------:|:--------:|-----------|
| Method A | 85.2% | 0.847 | [@sample2023research] |
| Method B | 87.5% | 0.871 | [@example2022deep] |
| Method C | 89.1% | 0.885 | [@textbook2021fundamentals] |

: Comparison of different methods {#tbl-comparison}

Reference tables using @tbl-comparison in your text. Tables are automatically numbered and added to the List of Tables.

### Tables with Custom Column Widths

| Approach | Strengths | Weaknesses | Scalability |
|----------|-----------|------------|:-----------:|
| Rule-based | Simple to implement | Limited flexibility | Low |
| Machine Learning | Data-driven | Requires large datasets | Medium |
| Deep Learning | High accuracy | Computationally expensive | High |
